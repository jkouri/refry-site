      <h1>Refry</h1>
      <h3>React Data Fetching for the REST</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
    Refry is a <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> plugin
    which creates simple interfaces for your components to interact with your
    RESTful API. Think of Refry as the poor-man's version of&nbsp;
    <a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/relay/">Relay</a> without the overhead
    of having to make any backend changes to your existing application.
    </p>

    <p>
    Refry automatically fetches your components' data dependencies on&nbsp;
    <code>componentWillMount</code> and <code>componentDidUpdate</code> when
    relevant props are changed so you don't have to worry about when and how to
    fetch your data. To make your resources available across multiple
    components, Refry normalizes and caches your resources in its internal&nbsp;
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux">Redux</a> state.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is what your component could look like:
    </p>

    <Example1 />

    <p>
    By defining your components data dependencies with the <code> resources
    </code> decorator, you tell Refry to load your Post on <code>
    componentWillMount </code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    By default, Refry will initialize your resource's value with an empty object
    so you don't need to check if your data has been fetched successfully. Refry
    will just re-render your component when it is.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's good and dandy, but what about some more complex components?
    </p>

    <Example2 />

    <p>
    When you specify the <code> schema </code> option on your resource
    definition, you tell Refry to normalize and store your data in its global
    state so that other components can use it as well.
    </p>

    <p>
    If your data can be lazy loaded, as you can see in <code> comments </code>
    above, you can modify your resource to not load automatically and instead
    load it later with the <code> fetch </code> method on it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Need to mutate your data? Do some other complex actions with it that aren't
    just a GET from your API? That's what <code> actions </code> are for.
    </p>

    <p>
    By setting the <code> actions </code> property on your resource definition,
    you tell Refry to add different methods on your resource which will allow
    you to dispatch different types of requests.
    </p>

    <p>
    So what happens after an <code> action </code> is executed? Does Refry
    update the resource it has in its state?
    </p>

    <p>
    It depends. If your API returned a resource from the action you can either
    remove it from the state, append it, or replace it completely with the
    returned resource.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, if the component above received a post resource with an ID
    after removing a comment, since we specified an <code> updateStrategy </code>
    of <code> remove </code> then Refry would attempt to remove that one post
    from the post's comments
    list.
    </p>

    <p>
    Alternatively, if our API did not return the removed comment resource, we
    could tell Refry to "force" another fetch of all of the post's comments by
    setting the <code> refetchAfter </code> property to <code> 'success'
    </code>.
    </p>
